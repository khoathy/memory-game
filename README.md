The project is to build a complete browser-based memory game application, a single-page app that is straightforward, simple, and clean.
The app was styled and developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

## Gameplay Rules

## Features

- Animations when cards are clicked, unsuccessfully matched, and successfully matched.
- Sounds on winning.
- Restart button to reset the game board at any time of the game.
- Move Counter that displays the current number of moves a player has made.
- Timer that starts when a player starts a game and stops when a player wins the game.
- Star Rating system: The game starts with 3 stars. After some number of moves, it changes to a lower star rating (down to 2, then to 1).
